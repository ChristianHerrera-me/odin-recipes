      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>12oz lasagna noodles</ul>
      <ul>15oz whole milk ricotta cheese</ul>
      <ul>2 cups shredded mozzarella divided</ul>
      <ul>1/4 cup graded mozzarella</ul>
      <ul>1 large egg</ul>
      <ul>1/4 tsp salt</ul>
      <ul>1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper</ul>
      <ul>10oz frozen spinach,thawed</ul>
      <ul>1 24oz jar of pasta sauce</ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add 1 tsp salt to season the water, then add the lasagna noodles. Boil the noodles just until al dente (they become too delicate to roll if they are too soft). Drain the noodles in a colander.</ol>
      <ol>While the noodles are boiling, drain the thawed spinach, squeezing out as much of the excess water as possible. Add the spinach to a bowl with the ricotta, 1 cup of the mozzarella, Parmesan, egg, salt, and pepper. Stir until everything is evenly combined</ol>
      <ol>Once the lasagna noodles have cooled enough to touch with your hands, lay a few noodles out onto a clean surface. Spread about ¼ cup of the spinach and cheese filling onto each noodle, spreading it from edge to edge. It's okay if the filling is thin or doesn't create a solid layer. Roll the noodles up, then place in a large casserole dish. Repeat with the remaining noodles until you've used all of the filling. You should get about 16 roll ups and you may have a few noodles left over (those will be back up in case any tear).</ol>
      <ol>Once all of the noodles are filled, rolled, and placed in the casserole dish, pour the jar of pasta sauce over top. Top the lasagna roll ups with the remaining 1 cup of mozzarella cheese.</ol>
      <ol>Cover the casserole dish with foil and bake the lasagna roll ups for 30 minutes in the preheated 400ºF oven. Serve hot and enjoy!</ol>
